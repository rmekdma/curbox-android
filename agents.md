# Curbox agent guide

Curbox is an Android screen time manager. One accessibility service blocks apps, short videos, keywords, and selected UI elements.

This file applies to the whole repository. Preserve more specific instructions if a nested `AGENTS.md` is added later.

## Start here

- Modules: `:app` and `:apitester`. The latter is a sample client for the Curbox API.
- Language and UI: Kotlin, classic Views, Fragments, and ViewBinding.
- Do not add Jetpack Compose or the Navigation component.
- JVM target: 17.
- Package root: `app/src/main/java/neth/iecal/curbox`.
- Prefer the smallest change that follows the nearest existing implementation.
- Readability is more important than cleverness. Follow the style of each file you touch.
- Ask before making an architectural change. Explain the user impact before changing the Room schema because migrations are destructive.
- Preserve unrelated work in the repository. Do not rewrite nearby code unless the task requires it.
- Add comments only when they explain behavior the code itself cannot express.

## Working sequence

1. Read the affected class and the closest similar feature before editing.
2. Trace all relevant process, flavor, persistence, and lifecycle boundaries.
3. Make the narrowest complete change. Reuse current patterns and dependencies.
4. Check every entry point, refresh path, cleanup path, and optional feature gate.
5. Run the most focused useful verification, then broader flavor builds when the change can affect them.
6. Report what changed, which checks ran, and any checks that could not run.

## Nonnegotiable invariants

### Accessibility service safety

`services/AppBlockerService.kt` must never crash because an individual feature fails.

- Keep feature calls inside the service's existing error containment boundaries.
- Log nonfatal failures through `CrashLogger.logNonFatalError` and swallow them.
- In coroutine workers, rethrow `CancellationException`; do not report it as a crash.
- Wire every new feature through its complete lifecycle: setup, receivers, event handling, and cleanup.

Never traverse accessibility node trees directly in `onAccessibilityEvent`.

- Cheap work such as app blocking, grayscale, focus mode, and lightweight tracking may run inline.
- Node walking belongs in the background worker fed by `Channel.CONFLATED`.
- Copy queued events with `AccessibilityEvent.obtain(event)`.
- Recycle every copied event in all paths, including failed sends, dropped events, exceptions, and shutdown.

### Multiple processes

The app runs in three processes:

| Process | Main component |
| --- | --- |
| Main | UI and `Curbox` application initialization guarded by `isMainProcess()` |
| `:app_blocker_service` | `AppBlockerService` |
| `:crash_handler` | `CrashLogActivity` |

This has concrete consequences:

- Access Room only through `AppDatabase.getInstance()`. It enables multi instance invalidation.
- Access settings only through `DataStoreManager` in `utils/DataStore.kt`.
- Never create a second DataStore for the same file. `DataStoreManager` owns the `MultiProcessDataStoreFactory` singleton.
- Do not assume initialization guarded by `Curbox.isMainProcess()` also ran in the service process.
- Sync initializes only in the main process.
- UI to service configuration updates use broadcasts unless that feature already collects the settings flow. Follow the feature's existing pattern.

### Settings compatibility and delay

`data/models/Settings.kt` is serialized as JSON with Gson.

- Every field must have a default value so older stored JSON still loads.
- Do not rename a field casually. A rename silently discards its stored value.
- Add a setting through `Settings`, an `updateX()` method in `DataStoreManager`, the UI, and the feature's refresh path.

Restriction settings are gated by the settings change delay. A change that weakens a restriction is stored as a `PendingSettingsChange`; a stricter change applies immediately and removes the pending value for that field. `RestrictionComparator` is conservative: a change it cannot prove stricter counts as weaker.

For every new gated field, update all of these:

1. `GatedSettingsField`
2. The `withFieldValue` branch
3. `utils/RestrictionComparator.kt`
4. The label in `ui/fragments/main/reducers/advanced/SettingsChangeDelayFragment.kt`

Due pending changes are applied by the service heartbeat, app startup, and the delay screen. Preserve all three paths.

### Room data

Room uses `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()`.

- Any entity change requires a database version bump in `data/db/AppDatabase.kt`.
- A version bump wipes local user data on upgrade.
- Tell the user about that tradeoff and get direction before implementing a schema change.
- Store large or growing records in Room. Store configuration in DataStore.

### Build variants

Gate optional behavior at every entry point, including UI, service setup and cleanup, manifests, and API responses.

| Flavor | Sync | UI hider | Anti uninstall | Internet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `full` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `playstore` | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| `fdroid` | No | Yes | Yes | No |

Relevant flags in `app/build.gradle.kts`:

- `SUPPORTS_UI_HIDER`
- `SUPPORTS_ANTI_UNINSTALL`
- `SUPPORTS_WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`
- `FDROID_VARIANT`
- `SYNC_USE_FCM`

The Play Store manifest removes `AdminReceiver` and `NodePickerService`. Do not expose those features through another route.

Real sync code lives in `app/src/sync/java`, which is compiled only by `full` and `playstore`. Interfaces and `SyncGateway` live in main. The F-Droid stub in `app/src/fdroid/java` returns `NoopSyncProvider`. Any sync change must leave `fdroid` compilable without sync only classes, Firebase, Supabase, or the INTERNET permission.

Sync is currently free in both sync flavors. `SyncEntitlement` is a free stub, and no flavor compiles Play Billing. Preserve that behavior unless the task explicitly restores billing. `SUPPORTS_WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` is false in `playstore`; keep grayscale and related UI consistent with that capability. `SYNC_USE_FCM` controls the FCM push migration in sync flavors.

## Architecture map

### Accessibility host

`services/AppBlockerService.kt` hosts all blockers, trackers, and anti-stimulants. It extends `services/BaseBlockingService.kt`, which owns the foreground notification, service protection heartbeat, global actions, and `isDelayOver()`.

A typical feature is a plain class with this lifecycle:

1. Instantiate it as a service field.
2. Call its setup method in `onServiceConnected()`.
3. Register its receivers after setup.
4. Call its cheap event check inline or its node walking check in the background worker.
5. Remove receivers and release resources in `onDestroy()`.

Feature broadcasts use companion constants such as `AppBlocker.INTENT_ACTION_REFRESH_APP_BLOCKER`. Settings screens write through `DataStoreManager` before sending the refresh broadcast.

### Feature locations

- `blockers/AppBlocker.kt`: schedules and usage limits. A package can belong to several groups and blocks when any group requires it.
- `blockers/ReelBlocker.kt`: Instagram reels, YouTube shorts, and Facebook reels. Runs in the background worker.
- `blockers/KeywordBlocker.kt`: reacts to website observations written by `WebsiteUsageTracker`; it does not scan visible screen text. Its unsupported browser check runs in the background worker.
- `blockers/FocusModeBlocker.kt`: temporary app and keyword blocking.
- `blockers/BrowserBlocker.kt` and `blockers/AntiUninstallBlocker.kt`: browser and device admin protection.
- `blockers/uihider/`: overlay based UI hiding and its scripting language. Node picking uses `services/NodePickerService`.
- `trackers/`: app usage, website usage, and short video counts. `WebsiteUsageTracker` has a 15 second heartbeat for browsers that omit URL change events.
- `anti_stimulants/`: `AutoDnd`, `GrayScaleFilter`, and `MindfulMessage`. Combine DND requests through `AppBlockerService.syncDndState()`.
- `hardcoded/`: all per app view IDs and configuration. Do not inline these values in feature code.
- `api/`: the exported AIDL service, user approval flow, and auth store. Keep responses consistent with flavor flags. See `CURBOX_API.md` and the `:apitester` client.

User facing blocking screens go through `ui/activity/WarningActivity` with the appropriate `Constants.WARNING_SCREEN_MODE_*` value. App rule guardian approvals are the exception: `AppRuleBlocker` opens the internal `GuardianApprovalActivity` directly so one denial produces only one lock activity.

### Service protection

`ServiceWatchdogJob`, `utils/ServiceProtectionManager`, `receivers/BootReceiver`, and the `BaseBlockingService` heartbeat keep the accessibility service alive and detect stops. Anti uninstall UI lives under `ui/fragments/main/reducers/advanced/`.

### Sync and cleanup

- End to end encryption uses `CryptoBox` and is covered by unit tests.
- `SupabaseRest` uses OkHttp directly. There is no Supabase Android SDK.
- Firebase is initialized manually from `FcmConfig`; there is no Google Services Gradle plugin or `google-services.json`.
- Remote usage is merged through `remoteAppUsage()` and `remoteWebsiteUsage()`; synced websites use `SYNCED_WEB_PACKAGE`.
- `utils/UsageStatsCleaner.kt` purges old local data.
- Backend cleanup SQL lives in `supabase/migrations/` and is applied separately, not by the Android build.

## UI and product copy

- Use ViewBinding and existing Fragment transactions.
- Use Material defaults and dynamic colors. Keep the visual style calm, minimal, and easy to scan.
- Prefer smooth transitions when views appear, disappear, or resize.
- Coolvetica is for strong onboarding typography. Inter is the normal app font.
- Put all user facing text in `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`. Follow the existing localization pattern for translations.
- Write for a nontechnical reader at about a sixth grade level.
- Keep sentences short and concrete. Use a real world example when an idea is difficult.
- Do not use hyphens, en dashes, or em dashes in user facing copy. This restriction applies to displayed text, not code, resource names, or developer documentation.

## Common change recipes

### Add a blocker or tracker

1. Add a plain class in `blockers/` or `trackers/` based on the closest feature.
2. Declare refresh actions as companion constants.
3. Wire the full lifecycle in `AppBlockerService`.
4. Keep node traversal in the background worker.
5. Add defaulted configuration to `Settings` and an updater to `DataStoreManager`.
6. Add delay gating when the setting controls restriction strength.
7. Wire UI and refresh behavior.
8. Apply every relevant flavor flag.

### Add a browser or app mod

Edit `hardcoded/BrowserUrlBarIds.kt` or `hardcoded/ReelAppConfig.kt`. Copy the closest entry and change only the package specific values. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Change the database

Update the entity and DAO, register them in `AppDatabase`, and bump the database version only after the destructive migration tradeoff is accepted.

## Build and verification

Use the check that matches the change. Documentation only changes do not need a Gradle build.

```bash
./gradlew testFullDebugUnitTest
./gradlew assembleFullDebug
./gradlew assemblePlaystoreDebug
./gradlew assembleFdroidDebug
./gradlew installAndGrantAccessibilityFullDebug
```

- `testFullDebugUnitTest` includes `CryptoBoxTest` and UI hider `ScriptLanguageTest`.
- Build all three flavors after changing shared source, source sets, manifests, BuildConfig gates, or optional feature wiring.
- Use the install task only when an emulator or device is available. It installs, grants accessibility through adb, and launches Debug Curbox.
- Lint does not abort builds, so inspect relevant warnings rather than treating a successful build as proof that lint is clean.
- Debug builds use the `.debug` application ID suffix and the name `Debug Curbox`.
- If a relevant check cannot run, say why in the handoff.

### Windows build environment

Set the JBR for the current PowerShell process before running Gradle:

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = 'C:\Users\DELL\.jdks\jbr-21.0.11'
& "$env:JAVA_HOME\bin\java.exe" -version
.\gradlew.bat testFullDebugUnitTest
```

Release APK commands and outputs:

| Variant | Command | Unsigned output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full | `.\gradlew.bat assembleFullRelease` | `app/build/outputs/apk/full/release/app-full-release-unsigned.apk` |
| Play Store | `.\gradlew.bat assemblePlaystoreRelease` | `app/build/outputs/apk/playstore/release/app-playstore-release-unsigned.apk` |
| F-Droid | `.\gradlew.bat assembleFdroidRelease` | `app/build/outputs/apk/fdroid/release/app-fdroid-universal-release-unsigned.apk` |

- Upload only the Full Release APK. Do not upload Play Store or F-Droid APKs.
- Use a semver version name in the form `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` and name the uploaded APK `curbox-<version>-full.apk` (for example, `curbox-v4.0.4-full.apk`).
- Upload the APK file directly to GitHub. Do not use CI for APK uploads.
- Treat only `*Release` tasks as release artifacts. Debug APKs use the `.debug` application ID suffix, the `Debug Curbox` label, and `application-debuggable`; never publish one as a release APK.
- Release tasks currently produce unsigned APKs. Verify signing before describing an APK as installable or publishing it without an `unsigned` warning.
- Before publishing a Full APK, inspect `app/build/outputs/apk/full/release/output-metadata.json`. It must report `variantName` as `fullRelease` and a version name matching `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.
- File size alone does not identify a flavor. The v4.0.1 GitHub assets were debug builds and are larger than equivalent release builds.
